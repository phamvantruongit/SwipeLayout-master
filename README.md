## Integration
**Option 1**
Copy the attrs.xml file to the src/res/values folder and the SwipeLayout.java file to the source code folder of your project from the [gist](https://gist.github.com/ArmanSar/64359efd499ed38f6996390e79a5eadc) and to use.

**Option 2**

Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

Add the following dependency to your module's build.gradle:
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.ArmanSar:SwipeLayout:1.0.9'
}
```

## How to use ?
Example of use. Swipe to the left
```xml
<mobile.sarproj.com.layout.SwipeLayout
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:id="@+id/swipe_layout"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="90dp"
    app:draggedItem="@id/drag_item"
    app:rightItem="@id/right_view"
    app:swipeDirection="left">

    <ImageView
        android:id="@+id/right_view"
        android:layout_width="90dp"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:layout_gravity="end"
        android:background="#ff5722"
        android:gravity="center"
        android:paddingEnd="24dp"
        android:paddingStart="24dp"
        android:src="@drawable/ic_delete"/>
  
    <TextView  
        android:id="@+id/drag_item"  
        android:layout_width="match_parent"  
        android:layout_height="match_parent"  
        android:background="#eeeeee"  
        android:gravity="center_vertical"  
        android:paddingEnd="10dp"  
        android:paddingStart="20dp"  
        android:textSize="20sp"/>

</mobile.sarproj.com.swipelayout.SwipeLayout>
```
```
Above is an example of a layout. For the correct operation of the swipe it is necessary to add <mobile.sarproj.com.swipelayout.SwipeLayout in your layout in which you need to specify the following parameters:
- app:draggedItem="@id/drag_item", where drag_item is the id of the element to be dragged
- app:rightItem="@id/right_view", where right_view is the id of the element that will remain on the right with the swipe to the left (if you use swipe to the right, you must specify app: leftItem).
- app:swipeDirection="left" - direction of a swipe
  - app:swipeDirection="left" - swipe to the left
  - app:swipeDirection="right" - swipe to the right
  - app:swipeDirection="left|right" - swipe left and right
```

## Description of parameters
**Required**
```
- app:draggedItem="@id/drag_item" - where drag_item is the id of the element to be dragged
- app:rightItem="@id/right_view" - where right_view - id of the element that will remain on the right with the swipe to the left
- app:leftItem="@id/left_view" - where left_view - id of the element that will remain on the left with the swipe to the right
- app:swipeDirection="left" - direction of a swipe
  - app:swipeDirection="left" - swipe to the left
  - app:swipeDirection="right" - swipe to the right
  - app:swipeDirection="left|right" - swipe left and right
```

**Optional**
```
- app:isFreeDragAfterOpen="false|true" - allows the main view to move after its opening
- app:isFreeHorizontalDrag="false|true" - allows you to move the main view in the opposite direction to the swipe
- app:isContinuousSwipe="false|true" - allows you to execute the swipe to the end of the screen
- app:isTogether="false|true" - the secondary view will move along with the main view
- app:autoMovingSensitivity="1000" - sensitivity of automatic closing of the main view
- app:rightDragViewPadding="0dp" - the right bounding border of the swipe for the main view
- app:leftDragViewPadding="0dp" - the left bounding border of the swipe for the main view
```

**Control from the code**
```
SwipeLayout.close() - cancel swipe, return the main view to its original state
SwipeLayout.openLeft() - execute swipe to the right
SwipeLayout.openRight() - execute swipe to the left
SwipeLayout.openRightCompletely() - execute swipe to the right to the end of the screen 
SwipeLayout.openLeftCompletely() - execute swipe to the left to the end of the screen 
SwipeLayout.close(false) - cancel swipe, return the main view to its original state without animation
SwipeLayout.openLeft(false) - execute swipe to the right without animation
SwipeLayout.openRight(false) - execute swipe to the left without animation
SwipeLayout.openRightCompletely(false) - execute swipe to the right to the end of the screen without animation
SwipeLayout.openLeftCompletely(false) - execute swipe to the left to the end of the screen without animation
SwipeLayout.isClosed() - is the main view in the default state
SwipeLayout.isMoving() - is the main view in the moving
```
**Callback**
```java
SwipeLayout.setOnActionsListener(new SwipeLayout.SwipeActionsListener() {
    @Override
    public void onOpen(int direction, boolean isContinuous) {
        if (direction == SwipeLayout.RIGHT) {
            // was executed swipe to the right
        } else if (direction == SwipeLayout.LEFT) {
            // was executed swipe to the left
        }
    }

    @Override  
    public void onClose() {  
        // the main view has returned to the default state
    }
});
```

**Note**
```
- the isContinuousSwipe flag works in two modes, with a secondary view (app:leftItem, app:rightItem) and without it
- if you use both swipe left and right (app:swipeDirection="left|right"), the isContinuousSwipe flag will be ignored
- if a specific direction of the swipe is specified and the isContinuousSwipe flag is set, the isFreeDragAfterOpen flag is automatically set to true
- if you use swipe and left and right (app:swipeDirection="left|right"), the isFreeHorizontalDrag flag will work differently. It will set the mode at which the main view will continuously move in both directions
